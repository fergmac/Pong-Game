# Pong Game

I found this project to be quite challenging and spent most of my time going over and trying to understand and rebuild what we created on Thursday and Friday. 

Object based programming including the constructors, properties and methods are beginning to make more sense to me. I've been spending most of my free time going through the various online javascript lessons and i'm gaining a better understanding. I look forward to taking the pong game to the next level through the stetch goals.
